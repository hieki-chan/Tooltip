"You are free to modify, add, delete,... (whatever you want) any code in the project.

However, please note that assets included in the demo project, e.g. images, sounds, 3D models, etc., 
I obtained these assets from various sources, such as  Asset Store, Google,... 
so I'm not sure which ones can be used for commercial use. :)
