## How to Use
1. Attach the `Tooltip` script to the desired UI element or create a new game object and add the script as a component.
2. Customize the appearance of the tooltip by adjusting its properties in the Unity Inspector, such as font size, colors, and alignment.
3. Set the content of the tooltip using the `SetText` method in your script or directly in the Unity Editor's inspector.
4. Run the application, and when the user hovers over the designated UI element, the tooltip will appear with the configured content.
